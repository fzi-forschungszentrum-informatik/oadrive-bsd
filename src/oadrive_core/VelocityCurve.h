/*! Stores parameters, and provides various convenience functions, for

 *  acceleration and jolt values, to guarantee a certain smoothness
 *  (e.g. to ensure passenger comfort).  The resulting curve takes the
 *  following form:
 *  - Apply the maximum jolt (negative, if the target velocity is
 *    smaller than the initial velocity) for a time period #m_t1, but
 *    at most until the maximum acceleration is reached.
 *  - Apply a zero jolt for a time period #m_t2 (may be zero), i.e.,
 *    apply constant acceleration.
 *  - Apply the negative maximum jolt (positive, if the target
 *    velocity is smaller than the initial velocity) for a time period
 *    #m_t1, so that the acceleration is zero again, and the desired
 *    target velocity is reached exactly, when the time period ends.
